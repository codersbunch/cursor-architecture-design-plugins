description: Standards for inter-service communication in microservices architectures
alwaysApply: true

service-communication:

- Use async messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS) for non-critical cross-service calls
- Use synchronous REST or gRPC only for real-time, low-latency requirements
- Never share databases between services - each service owns its data
- Define explicit API contracts (OpenAPI/Protobuf) before implementation
- Implement circuit breakers for all outbound service calls
- Use correlation IDs for distributed tracing across services
- Version all APIs - never make breaking changes without a new version
- Prefer event-driven patterns for eventual consistency over distributed transactions
